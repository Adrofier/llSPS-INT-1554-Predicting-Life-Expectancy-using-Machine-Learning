# llSPS-INT-1554-Predicting-Life-Expectancy-using-Machine-Learning
A typical Regression Machine Learning project leverages historical data to predict insights into the future. This solution is aimed at predicting Life Expectancy rate of a country given various features.

The project tries to create a model based on data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) to evaluate the life expectancy for different countries in years. The data offers a timeframe from 2000 to 2015. The data originates from here: https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who/data The output algorithms have been used to test if they can maintain their accuracy in predicting the life expectancy for data they havenâ€™t been trained. Four algorithms have been used:

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
ElasticNet Regression
